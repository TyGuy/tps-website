To Do:

- make login secure


- highschool: a way to merge 2 similar highschools



- make email lists more comprehensive

LIST OF UPDATES TO MAKE TO THE DATABASE TABLES
================================================
Mentor:
 - app_id
 ===============================================

Farther away:
 - set dates for meetings (and auto-send email)
 - look at reviews of cohort 

 - periodically back up DB files

  - mentor page: have an overview of all mentors in the program (where they are, who they are)
  - separate berkeley and stanford

 - Flags - allow core team members to have the ability to flag mentees and/or mentors. (and resolve)
     - we could add something for responsiveness specifically. (then we can tag the respective mentee/mentor when the other is flagged)
 - Also Drop: allow people to drop mentees/mentors from the system.
 - what about status history? Allow us to change acceptances to graduated, dropped, etc., and not lose intermdediate information.
 	- can create a separate entity called "statuses" and link mentees/mentors to it with associations. (like comments, etc.)
 - College list
 	- add model into database about college list
 	- allow mentees to add that in.


ON EMAIL LIST:
===============================================================
 - make an option for only stanford (not all including berkeley)
===============================================================

 - display numbers next to mentee (and in all tables)
 - bulk accept mentees from applications 
 - A way of downloading spreadsheet of all groups of people

 - on matching, have mentees' applications visible
 - change cohort view so that mentees and mentors match

 - filter by different attributes and have that information visible
 - "Breakdowns" page
 - edit and/or delete comments
 - way to assign a block of mentees at a time.

 - detect mismatches and potential errors. 

 THINGS TO DO IMMEDIATELY FROM SPRAT:
 ========================================================
 ********
 - separate mentees with accepted and confirmed. (In general, implement mentee and mentor program history.
   This will include "program milestones", status changes, and (un)responsiveness)
 - Have numbers of mentors and mentees in cohort (and also the number of mentees/mentors that a cohort should have)
